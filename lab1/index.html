Topic of Website:
I am building a NASA-themed informational website. It will focus on space missions, astronomy facts, and NASA images.

Website That Appeals to Me:
The Smithsonian National Air & Space Museum website (https://airandspace.si.edu/) appeals to me. I like its clean layout, use of large visuals, and how it organizes educational content.
